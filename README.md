# passaic_nitrate_app
 NJ DEP Passaic River Nitrate Study App
The app is available at https://daverosenman.shinyapps.io/passaic_nitrate_app/

I made it over five years ago, so there are a lot of changes I would make if I were starting it over again from scratch (especially utilizing shiny modules).
